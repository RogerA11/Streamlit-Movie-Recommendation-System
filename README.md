In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical to ensure that individuals can make optimised choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true is movie recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

In this scenario, a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering that is capable of properly predicting a movie that a consumer will enjoy based on their historical preferences is critical..

Providing an accurate and robust solutions to this challenge has immense economic potential, with consumers of the system being personalised recommendations - generating platform affinity for the streaming services which best facilitates their audience's viewing.
